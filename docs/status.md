# Status

## Milestone 0: Foundations. DONE (confirmed 2026-10-25)

Confirmed by CI run 40237397289 (commit 856d513, green):
- third_party/SMR submodule at 79bc953bb4b9cf47614d317b4ba9fc9f615c43ea (checked in CI)
- AU and VST3 universal (x86_64 + arm64), minimum macOS 12.0 on every slice
- auval on the CI runner: AU VALIDATION SUCCEEDED (arm64 runner)
- tests/core_test.cpp (bit-exact pass-through) passed in CI

Confirmed by Bryn's own Logic test (docs/testing-milestone-0.md, checks 1-6):
- M4 mac mini, macOS Tahoe, Logic 11.2: all passed
- Intel Mac, macOS 12.7.8, Logic 10.7.8: all passed

Not tested: VST3 in any host (Logic loads AU only).

Choices made (see docs/open-questions.md): JUCE 8.0.6, AU type effect (aufx), codes Ptdt/Smru,
runner macos-15 (macos-14 retires 2 Nov 2026).

## Next: Milestone 1, source audit
Produce docs/architecture.md from the firmware source and the manual. Bryn answers the open
questions in docs/open-questions.md. No code changes in Milestone 1.

Note: CI logs cannot be downloaded in Claude's session (HTTP 403). The workflow writes results as
annotations (archs, minos, auval) so they can be read through the API.
